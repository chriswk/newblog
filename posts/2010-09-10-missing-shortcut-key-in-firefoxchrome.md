<p>Was working in Chrome today, and came over a missing feature. Just opened 10 different tabs with screenshots from a bug report from a user. Now the bug had been solved, but I either had to close tab by tab (using Ctrl+W (I'm a sucker for shortcut keys)) or close the entire process and reopen it (It starts up so fast this is usually the faster way).</p>
<p>Went in to Firefox and saw a plug-in which addressed this, so I guess I'm not the first one who thought this was a missing feature.</p>
