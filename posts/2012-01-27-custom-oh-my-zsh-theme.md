# My zsh theme

I use [oh-my-zsh](http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh "Oh My ZSH") for my
terminal. I've been rather fond of the bira theme; but it didn't offer anything
when I went into anything else but git repos. So I forked oh-my-zsh
[chriswk's oh-my-zsh](http://github.com/chriswk/oh-my-zsh "My oh-my-zsh fork")
and went to work in the themes directory. After having updated the upgrade
script to still upgrade/pull from robby's fork I add a chriswk.zsh-theme.
