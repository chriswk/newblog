<p>So <a href="http://www.onecall.no">Onecall</a> has had a good "Gavepakke" offer since September 29th or so. 199,- fixed price for 3 months free phone usage (until New Years). That is, unlimited calls, unlimited texts and unlimited data (though transfer speed will be reduced if you transfer over 5 GB in a month). Yesterday I ordered this. Today I got a phonecall from <a href="http://www.chess.no">Chess</a> (My current network). They offered me same deal as onecall until New Years, and then matched Onecalls "Folkepakke" (199 a month, 400 minutes, 400 texts, 400 MB data) and went a bit under (189 a month, 500 minutes, 500 texts, 500 MB data).</p>
<p>This offer is nowhere to be found on their webpages, which is a bit interesting.</p>
