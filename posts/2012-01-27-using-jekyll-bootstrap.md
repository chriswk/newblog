So, I toggled from a broken jekyll theme, to using
[jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/ "Jekyll bootstrap"). It took me
10 minutes from I decided until I was up and running, had ported all posts that
were already here and implemented a pygments stylesheet based off solarized.

The claim that [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") allows coders to blog in
code tempted me. Also, I'm not too fond of wordpress. Yes it allows me to do
more fancy things like planning a publish etc, but markdown and pygments allows
me to do what I've needed so far. Granted, I'm not a heavy blogger, so if I ever
become one (not likely, since this is my first post in 15 months) I might
reconsider going with one of the other blog sites/engines.
