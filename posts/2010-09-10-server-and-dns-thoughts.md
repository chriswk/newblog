<p>I've been running this server since a friend and me found SuSE 8 in Germany back in 2002. It's always been sort of a pet project.<br />
I've always been using <a href="http://www.dyndns.com">DynDns</a> for DNSing and domain registration.<br />
Which have always given me the possibility to set-up ddclient (or other client interfaces) to update my domains when my router restarts / gets a new IP.<br />
And since this server has been triggercs.com (My first Counter-strike clan), auditorfortuna.com (My old World of Warcraft guild), kurveien5.com (My old place) with lots of subdomains I've always relied on the automatic updater for updating the IPs.</p>
<p>Today I bought two new domains: chriswk.com and chriswk.org domains which I bought through a Norwegian company called <a href="http://www.domeneshop.no">Domeneshop</a>.<br />
Less than half the price for a year of domain registration and DNS. Dyndns charges $40 per domain, Domeneshop charges 99NOK (which is roughly $15).</p>
<p>Then I find out they don't support ddclient to update my A records, and I've been unable so far to find an alternative.</p>
<p>So still looking for a solution for updating the IP automatically if the router gets a new IP; but other than that, less than 30 minutes in total for registering the two domains and setting up sub-domains so I must say I'm really satisfied so far.</p>
